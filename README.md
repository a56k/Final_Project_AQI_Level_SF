### Final Project Overview

ML---Final-Project---Pollution & Future Impact Analysis -



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Purpose (Draft)

We are looking at air quality pollution data in San Francisco pre-COVID and comparing it to air quality pollution after lockdown. We have seen in various studies that air quality pollution levels in some cities have decreased during lockdown measures and subsequently increased when these cities began re-opening. Our question asks whether we should proceed to the fast enablement of acivities that are at the root cuase of emissions and conentrations of pollutants in SF;which then impacts the equilibrium that was creaed by the Lockdown memasures in this past year.

### Communication Protocol

We established our team's communication protocol in the early stage of the project. We were using tools such as Slack to share relevant information and schedule meetings to discuss our progress. 
Additionally, we have a google doc to track our conversation and progress made to the respective week's deliverables.

### Individual Branches 

The project's repository contains multiple branches, as seen in the attached picture. Each branch component is active to enable respective team members to commit their work and submit the repository link to canvas.

### Machine Learning Model

We are predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) as Safe or Unsafe. (AQI > = 150 is Unsafe)



For this classification problem we will compare **Ensemble* and **Resampling** techniques using Python sklearn library.  We will create a logistic regression, Random Forest, and Ada Boost classifier models, chose the best performer, and provide recommendations to future model improvements. In all escenarios, we will be fitting the training data, and making a prediction.

columns = CO, NO2, OZONE, pm10, pm2.5, SO2

target = AQI  this variable will be converted to binary = "Safe", "Unsafe"

Classification metrics like accuracy score, precision and sensitivity are analyzed for each target class to asses model performance.
