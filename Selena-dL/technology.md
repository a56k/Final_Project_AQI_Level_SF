# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will us Pandas to clean the data. We will perform an exploratory analysis with Jupyter Notebook and VS Code. Further analysis (i.e. merging/joining files) will be completed using Python and postgresQL (pgAdmin). Interactive plots of the cleaned/merged data will be made using Javascript.

## Database Storage
pgAdmin is the database we intend to use alongside AWS for storage. Further instruments will be added as necessary.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
We are currently displaying our work on our GitHub page. We will later integrate Google Slides and other platforms for presentation.
