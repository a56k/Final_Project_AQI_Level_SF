# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We performed an exploratory analysis using Jupyter Notebook and VS Code, prior to loading the raw data in pgAdmin. We used Pandas to clean the data: analyze/drop/rename columns & filter for our desired location(s). We will merge our clean datasets so that each pollutant is mapped over the same year using Python and/or postgresQL. Interactive plots of the cleaned/merged data will be made using Javascript.

## Database Storage
We are currently using the pgAdmin database to store our data. We plan to use this alongside AWS for storage, later in our analysis. Other instruments may be added if necessary.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
Our plots from each prior section will be displed on a webpage or in a presentation. Currently our work is displayed here on GitHub. Later we will integrate Google Slides and other platforms for our presentation.
